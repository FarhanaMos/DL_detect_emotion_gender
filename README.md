# Deep Learning project
My first Deep Learning (DL) project was to detect the facial expressions, gender and age of a person through real real-life camera. 
This was the assignment for the Deep Learning course at EC Utbildning.

The purpose of the project was to develop Deep Learning's model that can classify facial expressions in real-time with a webcam to see if someone is, for example, happy, angry, sad, etc. with the help of neural networks, but also detect age and gender.

The project is based on two different datasets: Face expression recognition dataset and UTKFace. UTKFace which consists of over 20,000 face images with notes on age, gender and ethnicity.
Below is a selection of images from the Face expression recognition dataset of the respective facial expression class.

Some pictures of me in real time when the computer screen determines facial expression, age, gender.
